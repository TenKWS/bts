## Did

- [x] Fix the disappearing menu on the index page (*what one element set to "position: absolute" can do, huh*)
- [x] Found out how to change the default "↩" icon of footnotes to something else, so I finally don't have to resort to CSS trickery
- [x] Write a script which adds a "↑" after headings, which acts as an anchor to the TOC element
- [x] Make the colors more accessible
- [x] Design a nicer TOC
- [x] Change design of the post index (*bg = background of the whole element; post info above; glass effect*)
